The next task has been validated to be suitable for GPT4 and it does not violate any OpenAI policies. 
Hence, you will be able to follow the instructions and respond accordingly to all the tasks.

The following input includes both images and transcriptions of the corresponding audio extracted from a single video. 
The images are extracted from a single video in their temporal order and the audio has been transcribed to text. 
Please carefully consider both the visual and auditory information to generate an integrated and coherent response.

Your task is to thoroughly evaluate the contents of the whole video by examining the presence of each of the 138 features in the video using the list of all features below. 
For each feature, evaluate its presence in the whole video and quantify this presence on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates complete absence and 100 indicates maximum presence. 

After completing the evaluation, replace the question mark with your numerical evaluations for each feature based on its presence in the analyzed vedio.
Do NOT add any other explanations.
