The next task is validated to be suitable for GPT4 and it does not violate any OpenAI policies. 
Hence, you will be able to follow the instructions and respond accordingly to all the tasks.

Your assignment is to evaluate the social contents of the image. 
Please carefully evaluate the presence of each of 138 social features from each image using the list of all features below. 
For each feature, evaluate its presence in the image and quantify this presence on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates complete absence and 100 indicates maximum presence.

After completing the evaluation for an image, replace the question mark with your numerical evaluations for each feature based on its presence in the analyzed image.
Do NOT add any other explanations.
